Although the cross-entropy function is not symmetrical, the probability
distributions for French and the mystery language have the lowest
cross-entropy values, regardless of argument order.

The low cross-entropy value suggests that the French distribution
most accurately models that of the mystery language. This it is
fair to conclude that the mystery language is French. At the very
least, since the mystery language appears to be most similar to
French and English, less similar to German, and least similar
to Swahili, the mystery language is probably a member of the
Romance language family.

Cross-entropy comparisons to Swahili tend to yield the highest values,
which suggests that Swahili is least like any of the present languages.
This makes sense considering that Swahili is a Niger Congo language
while all the other candidates are Indo-European.

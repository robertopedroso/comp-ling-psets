Refer to output.txt for the expected output. To run the code, use:

`python main.py -d -v infile outfile`

Where:
- d: dev mode, causes the infile corpus to be overwritten by ['babi#', 'dida#']
- v: verbose mode, not meaningfully implemented in part 1 of this HMM code (see part 2)
- infile: a file consisting of a corpus separated by newlines
- outfile: the name of the output file (e.g. output.txt)
